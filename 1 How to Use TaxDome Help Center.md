## Navigating the Help Center

We designed the Help Center to introduce specific features and guide you through common scenarios. You don't need to tackle every article at once. Instead, explore the Help Center as required. To assist you in navigating, we describe the structure of the Help Center below.

The Help Center consists of numerous categories. They are listed on the [**homepage**](https://help.taxdome.com/):
